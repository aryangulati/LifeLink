LifeLink Online Website for Donating Organs

Every day, people of all ages and backgrounds become donors of organs, eyes, and tissues which will give the hope to the people who are in dire need of organ. <br>
On average, 20 people die every day from the lack of available organs for transplant. One deceased donor can save up to eight lives through organ donation and can save and enhance more than 100 lives through the lifesaving and healing gift of organ donation. <br>
<b>The main aim of developing this application is to reduce the time to a great extent that is spent in searching for the right donor and the availability of the organ required.</b><br>
In this project we provided 2 registrations, one for User/Donors and another for Hospitals.<br>
After registration of donor he/she will get a mail of activation reassuring the person about registering. After the process of registration the person will log into the site in which it appears 2 option one is Donor and the other is recipient.<br>
In this project donor has separate form after logging in. Donorâ€™s data stored in donor table and his data directly stored in hospital table also. After that there is a check-up request for the donor to check his medical condition to see if he/she is ready to donate. <br>If not then it will give an alert message to the donor asking to seek medical tests in the other hand hospital will have the other login form to store the donor details and medical information. Common transplantations include kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs, bones, bone marrow, skin, and corneas. Some organs and tissues can be donated by living donors, such as a kidney or part of the liver, part of the pancreas, part of the lungs or part of the intestines, but most donations occur after the donor has died.<br>
